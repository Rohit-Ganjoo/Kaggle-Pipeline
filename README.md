## Kaggle Pipeline
### Roadmap of the Project:
[Here is the Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/wholesale-and-retail-orders-dataset)

### Data Extraction 
Using the Kaggle API, we have extracted the data using python by utilizing the library kaggle. The API key is in .json format which has to be fed to the python to start the extraction process 
Problem we are working on is ### Wholesale & Retail Orders which will be having two dataset one is 
* Orders, which contains the order date, delivery date, retail price, cost price, product id
* Product this contains product name, category, country 

### Data Cleaning and Crunching
Whole dataset was brought to pandas amd necessary data wrangling is doing, ensuring no null values, data consistency, standardization of elements, proper heading, and suitable datatypes to each column

### Data Modeling
Dataset is already in 
### Data Visualisation
