### Data Extraction 
Using the Kaggle API, we have extracted the data using python by utilizing the library kaggle. The API key is in .json format which has to be fed to the python to start the extraction process 
Problem we are working on is ### Wholesale & Retail Orders which will be having two dataset one is 
* Orders, which contains the order date, delivery date, retail price, cost price, product id
* Product this contains product name, category, country 

### Data Cleaning and Crunching
Whole dataset was brought to pandas amd necessary data wrangling is doing, ensuring no null values, data consistency, standardization of columns, proper heading, and suitable datatypes to each column.
Standardized Date is very important when it comes to analyze the company's performance over the years or months.

### Data Modeling
Data Modeling involves to structure the data to facilitates easy storage, efficient relationship, easy manipulation and faster retrival. 

### Data Analyzing
We have to analyze the data to get some important insights from it and act upon it. It is also important to cross validate the result to ensure data is making sense. SQL Queries are handy one to do the data query part efficiently.

### Data Visualisation 
Data Visulaization on Power BI, helps the end user to seek through the weak and strong zones of a business model. What are the influencial factors that is lowering down the sales and hampering the growth.
